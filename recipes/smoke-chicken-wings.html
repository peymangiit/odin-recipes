    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) according to manufacturer's directions.</li>
        <li>Mix 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning in a small bowl to make dry rub. Sprinkle over chicken wings.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken wings in the preheated smoker until tender, 1 to 1 1/4 hour.</li>
        <li>Combine hot pepper sauce, butter, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring often, until butter is melted and sauce is smooth. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Transfer smoked wings to a large bowl; stir in 1/2 of the sauce until wings are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Grill coated wings until skin is browned and starting to get crispy, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in remaining sauce until wings are well-coated.</li>
    </ol>
